# Mobile Password Manager - Development Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Completed ‚úÖ
- Home page (`app/index.tsx`) - displays PasswordList component
- Password detail page (`app/password/[id].tsx`) - shows selected password details
- PasswordList component - displays passwords in a FlatList with navigation
- Password context with dummy data and state management
- Basic navigation structure with Stack router
- NativeWind setup for styling

### Issues Found üîç
- `app/add.tsx` exists but appears to be empty (only 1 line)
- Context file is `.jsx` but imported as `.tsx` (minor inconsistency)
- No actual add/create functionality implemented
- No edit functionality (despite "Edit" button in header)
- No data persistence (using dummy data)

## Phase 1: Complete Core CRUD Operations

### 1. Implement Add Password Functionality
- Build the add password form in `app/add.tsx` with fields for website, username, password
- Add form validation and submit handling
- Connect to context to add new passwords
- Add navigation from home screen to add screen

### 2. Implement Edit Password Functionality
- Create edit password screen or modify detail screen for editing
- Connect the "Edit" button in the header to enable edit mode
- Add save/cancel functionality
- Update context to handle password updates

### 3. Add Delete Functionality
- Add delete option in password detail screen
- Add confirmation dialog for deletion
- Update context to handle password removal

## Phase 2: Enhanced UX & Navigation

### 4. Improve Navigation Structure
- Add floating action button or header button to access add screen
- Update Stack.Screen configurations for better UX
- Add proper back navigation handling

### 5. Add Search/Filter Functionality
- Add search bar to password list
- Implement filtering by website name
- Add sorting options

## Phase 3: Data Persistence & Security

### 6. Implement Local Storage
- Replace dummy data with AsyncStorage or SQLite
- Add data persistence for passwords
- Handle loading states

### 7. Add Basic Security Features
- Add password visibility toggle
- Implement copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Add basic password strength indicator

## Next Immediate Step
**Priority: Complete the Add Password functionality** since the route structure is already in place but the `app/add.tsx` screen is empty.
