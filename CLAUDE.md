## Data Storage Structure
```typescript
// Password object structure
interface Password {
    id: number;
    website: string;
    username: string;
    password: string;
}

// SecureStore keys:
// - password_{id}: JSON string of Password object
// - password_ids: JSON array of all password IDs
// - next_password_id: Next available ID as string
```

## Next Priority Tasks
1. Add data backup/export functionality
2. Password strength validation and generation
3. Enhanced security features (master password, biometric auth)

## Development Notes

- All CRUD operations are async and persist to SecureStore
- Individual password storage pattern for scalability
- Navigation handled by Expo Router with file-based routing
- Add screen configured as modal presentation in navigation stack
