## Commands to Run
- `npm start` - Start Expo development server
- `npm run lint` - Run linting (if configured)
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript checking (if configured)

## Data Storage Structure
```typescript
// Password object structure
interface Password {
    id: number;
    website: string;
    username: string;
    password: string;
}

// SecureStore keys:
// - password_{id}: JSON string of Password object
// - password_ids: JSON array of all password IDs
// - next_password_id: Next available ID as string
```

## Next Priority Tasks
1. Add search/filter functionality
2. Implement password security features (visibility toggle, copy-to-clipboard)
3. Add data backup/export functionality

## Development Notes
- Using NativeWind for styling (Tailwind CSS classes)
- Context provides: `passwords`, `setPasswords`, `selectedPassword`, `setSelectedPassword`, `addPassword`, `updatePassword`, `deletePassword`, `loading`
- All CRUD operations are async and persist to SecureStore
- Individual password storage pattern for scalability
- Navigation handled by Expo Router with file-based routing
- Add screen configured as modal presentation in navigation stack
