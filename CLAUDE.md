### ‚ùå Missing Features
- Data persistence (currently using dummy data)
- Search/filter functionality
- Password security features (visibility toggle, copy-to-clipboard)

## Commands to Run
- `npm start` - Start Expo development server
- `npm run lint` - Run linting (if configured)
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript checking (if configured)

## Current Dummy Data Structure
```javascript
{ id: number, website: string, username: string, password: string }
```

## Next Priority Tasks
1. Implement data persistence
2. Add search/filter functionality
3. Implement password security features (visibility toggle, copy-to-clipboard)

## Development Notes
- Using NativeWind for styling (Tailwind CSS classes)
- Context provides: `passwords`, `setPasswords`, `selectedPassword`, `setSelectedPassword`, `addPassword`, `updatePassword`, `deletePassword`
- Navigation handled by Expo Router with file-based routing
- Add screen configured as modal presentation in navigation stack

## Update Log
